      <h1 id="program"><span class="time">Program</span></h1>

<p>The goal of this workshop is to provide not only a publication venue for negative results, but also a forum for meaningful discussion and learning from them. This year the event will feature invited talks + live QA with Rada Mihalcea and Byron C. Wallace, and five thematic sessions, with live group QA with the authors working in the same subfield. These sessions wil span NLI, QA, dialogue, and representation learning, plus a general session for “lessons learned the hard way”. Eight more insightful negative results papers on a wide range of topics will be presented in an interactive section on gather.town, to be immediately followed by a panel on leaderboardism, reproducibility, and frustrations of trying to getting published systems to work (with Kawin Ethayarajh, Jesse Dodge and Rachael Thomas). And of course there will be plenty of opportunities to chat in gather.town during three social breaks.</p>

<p>Small changes may occur, please check the program again before the event. All times are in PST.</p>

           <strong>The ups and downs of word embeddings</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Word embeddings have largely been a “success story” in our field. They have enabled progress in numerous language processing applications, and have facilitated the application of large-scale language analyses in other domains, such as social sciences and humanities.  While less talked about, word embeddings also have many shortcomings – instability, lack of transparency, biases, and more. In this talk, I will review the “ups” and “downs” of word embeddings, discuss  tradeoffs, and chart potential future research directions to address some of the downsides of these word representations.</em></p>

             <strong>Negative results yield interesting questions, or: a bunch of stuff that didn’t work</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>I will discuss recent projects in which ideas did not pan out as expected, but where these initial negative results led to (arguably) more interesting questions. My hope is that these case studies of negative results — which ultimately led to work we viewed as compelling enough to warrant write-up — will foster discussion about when “negative” results are nonetheless interesting, and about the kinds of questions we ask in empirical NLP research.</em> <br /><br />
<em>The first two cases that I will discuss involve methods for learning from limited amounts of supervision, namely active learning and data augmentation. Concerning the former, we set out to investigate whether training data selectively sampled using one model was also comparatively useful when used to train a second, distinct model. But what we found was that active learning in general afforded modest and inconsistent benefits across datasets, even when considering only the first model. These findings reframed the work: Where we had been asking a somewhat narrow question about dataset transfer, our results called into question whether active learning was worth using in the first place, given inconsistent benefits and inherent drawbacks. With respect to data augmentation, we developed (what we thought was) a clever augmentation strategy appropriate for sequence tagging that seemed to afford performance benefits when coupled with a recently proposed unsupervised data augmentation method. But then we realized that random augmentation strategies worked just as well, and actually random augmentation (as opposed to, e.g., performing backtranslation) works for text classification, too. These findings raised the question: When augmentation “works” for NLP, what is behind this? Time permitting, I will also discuss ongoing work in which we have (so far) failed to: (i) Recover sensitive patient information from transformers pretrained over clinical notes, and (ii) Improve the factuality of abstractive summaries by explicitly penalizing inaccurate tokens, and how we are thinking about moving forward with these initial negative results.</em></p>

<p><em>Leaderboards do not only drive progress in NLP: the bias towards publication of positive, and particularly state-of-the-art results implicitly encourages the development of highly specialized and brittle systems. If the reported success cannot be reproduced, or does not generalize well, the main result is much frustration by the developers who pick up academic papers in search of something that would actually work.</em></p>
