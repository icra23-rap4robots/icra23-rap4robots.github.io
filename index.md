title: Workshop on Effective Representations, Abstractions, and Priors for Robot Learning
---

## <span style="color:#267CB9">Effective Representations, Abstractions, and Priors for Robot Learning</span>

Recent advances in robot learning have opened new avenues for research toward general-purpose, real-world intelligent robots. However, we are still far away from achieving this goal and challenges persist in perception, planning, control, and interaction. We are still struggling to find good representations that can leverage information from different sources and can help us generalize to different domains and tasks. Moreover, skill transfer between tasks and across robotic platforms is an open problem, making us revisit ideas of applying structured priors to learning. Priors can also help perform sample efficient learning on different robotic platforms, which is fundamental for robot learning. Furthermore, the composability of skills depends on the use of good abstractions, whose definition remains an open research question for robots. This workshop will try to identify connections in the above topics and discuss a unified framework that bridges robotic priors, representations, and abstractions towards a principled approach to scalable robot learning. We will bring together AI and robotics researchers from various fields to share knowledge and debate these hot topics, while we envision a special issue in a top robotics journal (RA-L) on a related topic.

Key themes that we will focus on:

* Representation Learning
* Multisensory Learning and Fusion
* Scene Understanding
* Transfer, continual/ lifelong learning
* (Non-stationary) Reinforcement Learning
* Structured priors
* Model-based RL and World models
* Hierarchical learning and planning
* Skill composition and decomposition
* Large Language models in robotics
* Neurosymbolic AI in robotics

The RAP4Robots Workshop invites short papers as well as non-archival abstract submissions for papers published elsewhere (e.g. in one of the main conferences or in non-Robotics venus). Our goal is provide an opportunity to share knowledge and debate how to efficiently use representations, abstrations and priors in robotic settings.

Thank you to our sponsors for helping us organize the workshop.
