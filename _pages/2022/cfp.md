(ICRA 2023)

## Overview

The workshop will discuss key issues related to scalable and generalizable robot learning. While robot learning holds the promise of endowing robots with complex and generalizable skills, in practice, the generalization and scalability of these skills is an open problem. One pressing issue is the type and quality of representations that we could learn,e.g., when learning in simulation or when learning in different domains. Moreover, the sample-efficient learning of modular skills is crucial for robotics, and in this regard, the use of robotic priors, either classical or learned, can benefit learning. This makes researchers think about the best way to induce prior knowledge into a learning system. Additionally, the decomposition of complex long-horizon tasks into a sequence of simpler ones is a well-known strategy in robot planning. However, the type and levels of abstractions needed are open questions.

This workshop will bring together a cohort of top researchers, both early-career and established ones, to discuss these highly relevant problems, and open up new directions for developing systems and algorithms for robot learning that respect top-down and bottom-up compatibility (in terms of representations, abstractions and sequencing strategies). Our invited speakers bring a diverse background both in terms of scientific origins, but also in terms of cultural diversity. We hope that, among others, this will allow us to discuss ways where robot learning can generalize to different needs across the borders of common western communities. In this regard, we firmly believe that this workshop abides and complements the key theme of ICRA 2023.

Our panel topics will discuss fundamental open research questions, such as:

* Representation learning
* Multisensory learning and fusion
* Scene understanding
* Transfer, continual/ lifelong learning
* (Non-stationary) Reinforcement Learning
* Structured priors
* Model-based RL and World models
* Hierarchical learning and planning
* Skill composition and decomposition
* Large Language models in robotics
* Neurosymbolic AI in robotics

## Format

The workshop will host short talks on key topics of expertise of the speakers, followed by different panel discussions. The talks will be streamed online via YouTube. We plan to use an interface like Slido to collect questions from both the in-person and virtual audience. Use of Miro Boards will allow us to better organize and disseminate the topics discussed in the panels with the diverse audience. To facilitate the dissemination of research presented at our workshop, we plan for in-person poster sessions and virtual ones hosted in MIRO (miro.com). In that way, the authors can interact with the audience later, after the end of the workshop. The collected material can be used then as a starting point for an editorial for a special issue of a journal, like a RA-L special issue.
